# CrossLayerAI Core Value Propositions

## The Four Pillars

1. **Capture In-Game Information** - We can capture any in-game information about the player (whatever content it might be)

2. **Analyze In-Game Events** - We can analyze in-game events to understand what matters emotionally, not just statistically

3. **Persistent Memory Engagement** - Our agents keep players engaged as they build persistent memory for each player over time

4. **Re-engage Everywhere** - We can understand players better and re-engage them with personalized messages and offers EVERYWHERE (Discord, TikTok, Web, etc.)

### F2P Economics (For Studio Conversations)
- **3% of players (whales/dolphins) drive 50%+ of revenue**
- Churned player LTV is **"at 100% potential"** — any re-engagement is pure upside (John Wright, Kwalee)
- Push notifications are **"underutilized"** for re-engagement (industry admission)

## Whale-Focused Messaging (For F2P Studios)

**Primary:**
> "Recover LTV from churned whales through memory-based re-engagement on Discord."

**The Math:**
> "When a dolphin churns, their LTV is sitting at 100% potential. Push doesn't work. Discord has 80%+ daily presence. We reach them with messages that reference their actual gameplay."

**For Monetization Consultants:**
> "You optimize LTV for active players. We recover LTV from churned whales. Same goal, different segment."
