# CrossLayerAI Core Value Propositions

## The Four Pillars

1. **Capture In-Game Information** — We can capture any in-game information about the player (whatever content it might be)

2. **Analyze In-Game Events** — We can analyze in-game events to understand what matters emotionally, not just statistically

3. **Persistent Memory Engagement** — Our agents keep players engaged as they build persistent memory for each player over time

4. **Re-engage Everywhere** — We can understand players better and re-engage them with personalized messages and offers EVERYWHERE (Discord, TikTok, Web, etc.)

## Competitive Differentiator (One Sentence)
