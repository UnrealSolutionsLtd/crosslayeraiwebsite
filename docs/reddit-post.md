## Title Options:
- `I built a tool that brings churned players back to your game`
- `Built a re-engagement system that actually works (not push notification spam)`
- `Your players forget you in 3 days. I built something that doesn't forget them.`

## Post Body:

**The Problem:**

Player retention is brutal. You spend months building your game, finally get players... and 70% are gone within a week. 

The "solution"? Push notifications. "We miss you! Here's 50 gems!" 

Players ignore these because they feel like spam. No context, no personalization, no reason to care.

**What I Built:**

CrossLayerAI - a companion system that:

1. **Remembers every player's journey** - That boss they almost beat. The clutch moment. Their playstyle. Forever.

2. **Reaches them where they are** - Not just in-game notifications. Discord DMs, social posts, wherever your community hangs out.

3. **Feels personal, not spammy** - Because it actually knows what happened in their playthrough.

**Example:**

Sarah played your game for 3 weeks, got stuck on a boss (got him down to 2% HP!), hasn't logged in for 10 days.

❌ **Push notification:** "We miss you! Come back for free gems!"

✅ **CrossLayerAI:** Discord DM - "Hey Sarah! Remember that Dragon Lord fight where you got him to 2%? You were SO close. I found a vid of someone who beat him with your build. Want to give it another shot?"

One feels like spam. The other feels like a friend.

**How It Works:**

- Drop in our SDK (Unity, Unreal, Godot, HTML5)
- Track the events that matter (boss kills, achievements, near-misses)
- We build a memory of each player
- Personalized outreach across platforms

**Why I Built This:**

I was tired of seeing great indie games die because players just... forgot about them. Analytics tell you players churned but can't DO anything about it. 

What if your game could actually reach out and remind players why they loved it?

**Current Status:**

Early stage, looking for devs who want to try this. Free for small studios during pilot.

Would love to hear what you think. Is this something you'd use?

## Even Shorter Version (for skeptical subs):

**Title:** `Built a player re-engagement tool that isn't push notification spam`

Players leave your game. Push notifications don't bring them back.

I built something that:
- Remembers each player's journey (that near-miss boss fight, the clutch moments)
- Reaches them on Discord, social, etc. - not just in-game
- Sends personalized messages based on THEIR playthrough

Instead of "We miss you!" spam → "Hey, remember when you got that boss to 2% HP? You were so close..."

Looking for indie devs to try it out.

## Key Changes:
- ❌ Removed: "AI", "LLM", "artificial intelligence"
- ✅ Used instead: "companion system", "tool", "personalized", "remembers"
- Focused on the PROBLEM (churn) and OUTCOME (players coming back)
- More indie-dev friendly tone
