# CrossLayerAI - Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

## One-Line Definition

> **F2P games with active Discord communities where players have shareable moments but no automated way to celebrate them.**

---

## Must-Haves ✅

| Criteria | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| **F2P model** | High churn = desperate need for re-engagement |
| **Active Discord** | That's where we deliver value |
| **Shareable moments** | Clips, achievements, clutch plays worth posting |
| **Multiplayer/Social** | More content, more engagement, more FOMO |

---

## Sweet Spot Genres

| Genre | Why | Example Moments |
|-------|-----|-----------------|
| **Battle Royale** | Kills, wins, clutch moments = endless content | Victory royales, kill records, squad wipes |
| **Competitive shooters** | Aces, highlights, rank-ups | Ace clips, rank promotions, clutch rounds |
| **Roguelites** | Run completions, rare drops, close calls | Boss kills, rare loot, near-death wins |
| **Social casino** | Big wins, jackpots, streaks (shareable dopamine) | Jackpots, win streaks, tournament wins |
| **MMOs/Live service** | Guild achievements, raids, milestones | Raid clears, world firsts, level caps |
| **Web3 games** | NFT drops, Discord-native, community-first | Rare drops, marketplace sales, achievements |

---

## Red Flags 🚩

- No Discord presence
- Single-player only (no social sharing)
- Premium/paid games (lower volume, less churn problem)
- Hyper-casual (sessions too short, no memorable moments)
- No live-ops/updates (static games don't need re-engagement)

---

## Quick Qualification Checklist

Ask these questions when evaluating a lead:

1. ✅ Do they have a Discord with **1k+ members**?
2. ✅ Is the game **F2P or live-service**?
3. ✅ Does gameplay produce **"highlight reel" moments**?
4. ✅ Are they struggling with **D7/D30 retention**?

**If yes to 3+, they're a fit.**

## Company Size Sweet Spot

| Size | Fit | Notes |
|------|-----|-------|
| **Indie (1-10)** | ⚠️ Maybe | Might not have bandwidth, but high pain |
| **Small studio (10-50)** | ✅ Best | Big enough to care, small enough to move fast |
| **Mid-size (50-200)** | ✅ Good | Has resources, needs differentiation |
| **Large publisher (200+)** | ⚠️ Longer sales | More stakeholders, slower decisions |

---

## Decision Makers to Target

| Role | Why |
|------|-----|
| **Head of Community** | Owns Discord, feels the pain daily |
| **Product Manager/Producer** | Owns retention metrics |
| **CEO/Founder** | Small studios - they do everything |
| **LiveOps Lead** | Owns re-engagement campaigns |

---

## Pain Points They'll Recognize

1. "Our Discord is dead between content drops"
2. "Players churn and we have no way to bring them back"
3. "Push notifications don't work anymore"
4. "We have great moments but nobody sees them"
5. "Our community team can't keep up with content"

---

## Value Prop by Persona

### To Community Manager:
> "Your players have amazing moments nobody sees. We capture them and post to Discord automatically - your community stays active without you doing more work."

### To Product Manager:
> "You're losing 70% of players in week 1. We remember what each player did and reach them on Discord with personal messages that actually bring them back."

### To CEO/Founder:
> "Your players have great moments nobody sees. We fix that - and turn those moments into re-engagement that works."
