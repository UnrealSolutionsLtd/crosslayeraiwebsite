## About CrossLayerAI

CrossLayerAI is an AI platform for game developers that captures in-game events, builds persistent memory for each player, and re-engages them with hyper-personalized messages across Discord, TikTok, email, and other channels.

### Core Capabilities

1. **Capture Game Moments**: SDK integration captures player achievements, clips, and memorable moments in real-time
2. **Persistent Player Memory**: AI builds a memory of each player's journey, preferences, and play style
3. **Cross-Channel Engagement**: Reach players on Discord, TikTok, email, and other platforms with personalized content
4. **AI Community Management**: Automated Discord bots that remember player context and engage authentically

### Key Differentiators

- **Beyond In-Game NPCs**: Unlike Inworld AI or Convai, CrossLayerAI focuses on re-engagement across ALL channels, not just in-game interactions
- **Memory-First Approach**: Every interaction builds on previous context for genuine personalization
- **LiveOps Integration**: Works alongside existing analytics and engagement tools
